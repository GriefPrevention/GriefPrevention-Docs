# GriefPrevention Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the GriefPrevention Bukkit plugin.

GriefPrevention is compatible with Purpur, Spigot, Paper, and any other implemention of the Bukkit API.

Get started either by
- Searching for what you want in the searchbar at the top, or
- Selecting a topic of interest on the left
  - or if on phone, by tapping the hamburger button (menu button) on the top right.

If any page is missing info, has typos, or is just plain wrong, feel free to fix it via the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of any page. You can also add new pages too.
