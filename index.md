# GriefPrevention Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the GriefPrevention Bukkit plugin. This is where you can learn how to use and setup GriefPrevention for your Minecraft server!

{: .note }
GriefPrevention is undergoing major changes in its "alpha" versions (v17+), and this documentation will be modified to reflect these new changes. If you're using the legacy version of GriefPrevention (v16), use <https://legacy.griefprevention.com>

If any page is missing info, has typos, or is just plain wrong, feel free to fix it via the "Edit this page" link at the bottom of any page. You can also propose new pages too.

GriefPrevention is a Bukkit plugin, and therefore is compatible with the following Minecraft **server** modifications:
- Purpur
- Spigot
- Paper
- CraftBukkit
- any other implemention of the Bukkit API.

1. Put the `GriefPrevention.jar` file in your server's `plugins` folder.
